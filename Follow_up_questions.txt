Questions on the sample data provided:
For credit bureau reports samples
(credit_bureau_report and credit_bureau_report2), should the value for
the key 'riskModel' be a dict (consistent with
the other keys: 'tradeline', 'consumerIdentity') rather than a list of a dict?
e.g. 'riskModel': [{'credit_score': '0787'}].

If so, this would ensure consistency with the other key, value pairs ('tradeline', 'consumerIdentity')
in the credit_bureau_report samples.
Furthermore, using an integer slicing
technique to extract the values of a key seems prone to error/ordering
of the items (in this case there is only one list value, but this 'riskModel'
key could have more detailed information in future).
